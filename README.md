# Hangman

This is a simple hangman game written in Python.

It was actually originally written as one of my first projects to learn
programming before studying in university as part of the MIT OpenCourseWare
[6.00.1x Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python][1].

It was a lot of fun to revisit, fix a couple small bugs, and see how my coding
skills have improved.

Feel free to take and use at your own discretion.
